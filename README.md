• Cadence, the new programming language that makes smart contract development faster, safer

• Flow Client Library (FCL), it is analogous to Web3.js on Ethereum, but built for the consumer audience in mind

• Flow multi-node architecture, future-proof scaling for the mainstream adoption

# Mainstream ready.
Trusted by world class brands including NFL, NBA, Ticketmaster, and Mattel. Flow provides frictionless onboarding, 
with easy user registration like social logins, familiar payment methods, and the option to use any wallet of choice. 
Flow is mobile-ready to bring web3 to your community everywhere, allowing seamless user experience across iOS and Android platforms.

# Utility driven.
User-centric account model provides world-class security, safety and recoverability of accounts.
While it's easy to use resource-oriented programming language, Cadence, makes smart contract development faster 
and allows for more on-chain utility.

# Battle-tested.
Flow is a highly scalable permissionless blockchain designed for massive throughput. 
It's resilient architecture has 99.99%+ uptime and 300M+ transactions and counting.

# Cadence
Cadence is a resource-oriented programming language that introduces new features to smart contract
programming that help developers ensure that their code is safe, secure, clear, and approachable. 
Some of these features are:

*Type safety and a strong static type system.

*Resource-oriented programming, a new paradigm that pairs linear types with object capabilities to 
create a secure and declarative model for digital ownership by ensuring that resources (which are 
used to represent scarce digital assets) can only exist in one location at a time, cannot be copied,
and cannot be accidentally lost or deleted.

*Built-in pre-conditions and post-conditions for functions and transactions.

*The utilization of capability-based security, which enforces that access to objects is restricted to 
only the owner of the object and those who have a valid reference to it. This is Cadence's main form of access control.
